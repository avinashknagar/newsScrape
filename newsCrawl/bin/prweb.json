The clinic says that it will be offering the skills of some of Southern California\u2019s finest board certified plastic surgeons in a welcoming and attractive setting. The chief plastic surgeons at the institute, Huntington says, will be Dr. Sepideh Saber and Dr. Mort Rizvi. The medical center says that Dr. Saber has achieved recognition for an approach that blends the abilities of an expert plastic surgeon with an unusual level of sensitivity. Huntington says that, as a woman and a mother, Dr.Saber brings a unique perspective to a male-dominated field. Dr. Saber herself adds that, while many women might feel more comfortable with a woman plastic surgeon performing mommy makeovers and other female-centric procedures, she has worked very productively with people of all genders. She adds that even fairly traditional males often feel they can benefit from a more empathetic approach based on careful listening to patients. Moving on, the Huntington Plastic Surgery Institute says that Dr. Mort Rizvi is arguably one of the most versatile physicians working in California. Board certified in both plastic surgery and hand surgery, Dr. Rizvi has also worked as a craniofacial and reconstructive surgeon. He is also a widely noted expert in microsurgery, says the institute. After beginning his medical training in Maryland and then completing his residency at Houston Methodist Hospital, Huntington says that Dr. Rizvi has worked with some of the most prestigious names in Southern California medicine, including Los Angeles County + USC Medical Center as well as Children's Hospital. The institute adds that it offers all of the most commonly obtained procedures including  , breast and buttock augmentation, liposuction, tummy tucks, and more. The medical center adds that it also provides such widely obtained facial rejuvenation procedures as surgical facelifts (rhytidectomy) and eyelid lifts (blepharoplasty). Also on offer are nonsurgical facial rejuvenation including Botox and fillers, says the institute. It says that, while many practitioners without MDs are legally allowed to provide injectables, there are important benefits in terms of safety and outcomes when these products are provided by a board certified plastic surgeon. The Huntington Plastic Surgery Institute is located on the second floor of 3900 Congress Street approximately one mile from the 134 Freeway\u2019s Orange Grove exit in Pasadena.

In the 7 Most Important Secrets of Successful Root Cause Analysis, the first tip shared is a key foundation for reliable root cause analysis:  1. Your root cause analysis is only as good as the information you collect. Many root cause systems operate as a \u201cstandalone\u201d module. Information goes in and an answer comes out, without helping investigators collect accurate information. Some root cause tools actually develop a hypothesis first, then assimilate information to verify or disprove the hypothesis. Extensive research has proven that once an investigator becomes invested in a particular hypothesis, her/his brain automatically looks for \u201cfacts\u201d to confirm the hypothesis and disregards \u201cfacts\u201d that are counter to the hypothesis, resulting in the investigator finding what she/he wants to find. 2. Your knowledge (or lack of it) can get in the way of a good root cause analysis. 3. Understand what happened before why it happened. Beginning by asking \u201cWhy\u201d is jumping to conclusions. This often leads the investigator to presume, rather than seeking to understand.   4. Interviews are not about asking questions. 5. All human performance problems cannot be solved with discipline, training, and procedures. 6. Many people cannot see effective corrective actions even if they can find the root causes. 7. All investigations do not need to be created equal (but some investigation steps cannot be skipped). Learn more about the 7 Secrets and thorough and credible root cause analysis in the  .

(EXCLUSIVE) is officially a recipient of the 2020 BrightEdge\u202fEdgie Award for outstanding work in the Digital Marketer category. This honor, which recognizes multi-channel marketing success, was awarded to the EXCLUSIVE team for its successes in partnership with a leading equine supplies company.  Led by expert marketer Ariana Sandillo, the EXCLUSIVE team was able to drive increased eCommerce revenue for the merchant, a supplier that had historically relied heavily on revenue generated from brick-and-mortar sales. With in-person shopping compromised by the 2020 pandemic, Sandillo worked closely with the business\u2019s owner to create a bold new plan that met the challenges presented and drove more demand through eCommerce.  Sandillo and her team of seasoned EXCLUSIVE eCommerce strategists created and implemented a personalized plan tailored specifically to the client\u2019s individual goals and the industry. By leveraging a multi-channel approach that included Google Ads, search engine optimization, social media, and additional outlets, the team created a wide-reaching strategy to not only drive engagement but to drive transactions.  The goal was clear: efficient revenue growth that compensated for the decline of brick-and-mortar sales. And that goal was met and exceeded during the nine-month span from January to September 2020. For Google Ads and Bing performance, the business experienced a 38% growth in year-over-year revenue, peaking in the month of August when the business doubled its revenue compared to the previous August. Social media marketing growth was also successful with an 87% revenue increase during that same nine-month timeframe.   \u201cIt is an absolute pleasure to work with each and every member of this amazing EXCLUSIVE team,\u201d said a representative from the supply company. \u201cBeyond the remarkable increase in revenue, my EXCLUSIVE team also delivered unmatched customer service. This mattered even more given how everyone has been stretched thin this year. My EXCLUSIVE team was always available and attentive; I feel like their top priority, no matter what. There are many other reasons I enjoy working with EXCLUSIVE: our impressive growth, the full spectrum of services they offer, and their webinars and educational content. But truly, it is the incredible team I get to work with that means the most to me.\u201d  The win marks EXCLUSIVE\u2019s second Edgie Award. In 2018, the company earned the Elevating SEO Agency Edgie for its work with automotive parts retailer Eastwood. EXCLUSIVE was also a finalist for the overall Content & SEO award in 2017.

The Exodus Road fights human trafficking by sending national and foreign operatives to suspected human trafficking locations to gather intelligence and evidence. To date, their organization has been directly involved in the rescue of nearly 1500 victims of human trafficking and the arrests of almost 600 criminals in six different countries. Using Case Closed Software, the company expects to improve these global operations and manage cases more effectively, ultimately resulting in the rescue of more and more victims. The Exodus Road began through the work of co-founders Matt and Laura Parker who, in 2010, operated a children\u2019s home in rural Northern Thailand. During that time, Matt and Laura were exposed to marginalized people groups \u2013 targets for human trafficking. Eventually, Matt began networking with news media and local police to learn about the problem at the ground level. After a period of research, he was deputized by police and started working personally to find those trapped in slavery. Today, they lead a team of 70 staff members, many of whom are national operatives who work closely with vetted police partners. \u201cWith operatives and investigators around the world, we needed a truly powerful and multi-jurisdictional investigation management system,\u201d said Ryan Hill, director of Global Operations at The Exodus Road. \u201cWe chose the Case Closed Software solution because of its impressive feature set, multi-language support, and ease of use for our field operatives.  Case Closed Software will allow us to stay organized and share case files electronically with local law enforcement agencies around the world. We can even plan rescue operations directly within the system.\u201d Case Closed Software\u2019s founder and CEO, Douglas Wood, commented \u201cWhen we first met the folks at The Exodus Road, we were shocked to learn how widespread this criminal activity is. Human traffickers operate in a shadowy underworld that knows no borders and has no mercy for its victims. Case Closed Software is a perfect fit for anti-human trafficking investigations. Our software allows operatives to collect and share intelligence and evidence and helps track the people, locations and other entities involved in these horrendous crimes.\u201d The Case Closed Software investigation management platform deployed by The Exodus Road includes end-to-end case management with a configurable workflow, tips and leads management, evidence tracking, operations planning, multi-language support, and a host of other powerful features including entity deconfliction and visualization.

Business travelers are the lifeblood of these industries and with business travel on pause, the dominoes are beginning to fall, and for many, it all begins with the airline industry.  , an online air travel information tool recently acquired by  , conducted a survey among 1,300* of its subscribers to determine how travel bans have impacted their business, how they are adjusting, and if alternative solutions to conducting business, such as virtual conferencing, are enough to survive. The   covered a variety of topics, including: \r\n 1. Travelers\u2019 trust in airlines and hotels to self-impose and regulate effective safety measures\r\n 2. The impact travel bans are having on job performance\r\n 3. Views on effective use of remote communication tools versus in-person meetings\r\n 4. Work/life balance without business travel\r\n 5. The airline industry\u2019s impact on the overall economy ExpertFlyer asked several travel industry experts to weigh-in on the results of the survey and provide some commentary on the future of business travel. The panel of experts included Consumer Reports Aviation Adviser,  ; Jason Wynn, Chief Commercial Officer,  ; Chris Lopinto, Founder,  ; and Patrick Fragale, Executive Vice President at  , who shared his insight during a recent   with ExpertFlyer. \"Small businesses are the lifeblood of the American economy, and they are being hit hard by this pandemic, particularly by the lack of travel,\u201d said Jason Wynn, Chief Commercial Officer at Upside Business Travel. \u201cThere is a hunger to get back to business and that means getting back on the road, but there\u2019s a catch. 81% of business travelers anticipate traveling in 2021, but 82% of business travelers won\u2019t feel confident traveling until there is some form of a vaccine, even if imperfect.\u201d \u201cYou have to be careful about some of the statements that organizations are putting out there, like 'Every airline in the United States has HEPA filters,'\u201d explains William J. McGee, Aviation Adviser at Consumer Reports. \u201cWhile it may be true that every airline in the United States has aircraft with HEPA filters, not every aircraft operating on behalf of those airlines has them.\u201d Among the key survey highlights:\r\n The survey also revealed mixed emotions about working remotely, and the eventual need for in-person communications. Approximately 57% said that remote communications tools such as Zoom and Teams were good short-term solutions, but face-to-face meetings will need to happen soon. However, the survey also showed that 37% want their respective companies to invest more in work-from-home software tools, suggesting that employees are content with working from home, at least in the short term. \u201cWhile many agree that video conferencing has been a great short-term solution for a lack of face-to-face meetings or onsite functions, the majority of respondents feel it won\u2019t replace the value of in-person meetings and gatherings,\u201d said Chris Lopinto, Founder of ExpertFlyer.com. \u201cMany feel that returning to face-to-face engagement will be essential to long-term success, and even survival of their jobs, so once again we get the sense that business travelers (and businesses in general) are growing a bit anxious and impatient to get back in the air.\u201d Patrick Fragale, Executive Vice President at Valerie Wilson Travel concurs. \u201cOur clients are stating that virtual meetings are okay for the short term but unanimously feel that nothing can take the place of in-person relationships and look forward to traveling.\u201d As an executive of a large travel company, Mr. Fragale also had the inside track on what corporate clients are thinking, and what the airlines are doing to secure a larger customer base and protect them. \u201cMost of our corporate clients are currently allowing essential domestic travel and expect to expand that during the fourth quarter of 2020, continuing to scale upward in 2021,\u201d Fragale said. \u201cAir travel is key to the continued success of most business and leisure opportunities. Legacy airlines, such as Delta, American and United have certainly continued to demonstrate their desire to do whatever is in their power to prevail and improve the airline experience so that travelers feel safe.\u201d The full story, as well as an   with complete survey results, are available on ExpertFlyer\u2019s  .

This has necessitated device makers for consumer, medical, commercial, and educational applications to search for displays that are easier on the eyes, low-power, and are readable in direct sunlight. They\u2019re moving away from traditional backlight LCD technology and toward Reflective LCDs (RLCD) which use sunlight and ambient light to illuminate a display. RLCDs with the FLEx frontlight make these displays viewable in dark conditions. RLCD manufacturers have scaled up production and expanded panel sizes to meet rising demand. FLEx\u2019s new operating center in China is part of the strategic response to the increasing interest for portable electronics that can hold a charge for an extended period of time.    The new facility in Changzhou will focus on application engineering, new product development, supply chain management, and testing. FLEx closely partners with device makers innovating away from backlight technology. \u201cOur dedicated team in China is committed to helping customers adopt more efficient power-saving displays and ensuring fast response times during new product scale-up,\u201d says Mike Casper, CEO and co-founder of FLEx.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  The new facility in Changzhou is located near device and RLCD manufacturers and will allow closer collaboration as the technology swings into full adoption. It will also help FLEx shorten development cycles from pilot to mass production on new display sizes. \u201cWe\u2019re excited to provide our customers and suppliers with local support to help shorten development cycles for their new and exciting energy-efficient devices,\u201d Tom Klopcic, VP Sales & Business Development, Asia.

FLEx's front light works in combination with industry-leading Reflective LCDs to offer the same high resolution and video capabilities of traditional LCDs but at a fraction of the power consumed. With a range of 1\"-17\" in size, FLEx displays can easily integrate into your device. Contact: Diana Van Dusen\r\n Marketing Specialist\r\n 773-295-0305\r\n dvandusen@flexlighting.com"},
