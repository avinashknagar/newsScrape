Among Reata\u2019s drug candidates under development is omaveloxolone, which is in Phase 2 clinical development to treat Friedreich\u2019s ataxia (\u201cFA\u201d).\u00a0 Following the announcement of positive data from the MOXIe Part 2 study of omaveloxolone for FA in October 2019, the Company represented that it would seek submission for marketing approval of omaveloxolone for the treatment of FA in the U.S. with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (\u201cFDA\u201d). The Complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company\u2019s business.\u00a0 Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that:\u00a0 (i) the MOXIe Part 2 study results were insufficient to support a single study marketing approval of omaveloxolone for the treatment of FA in the U.S. without additional evidence; (ii) as a result, it was foreseeable that the FDA would not accept marketing approval of omaveloxolone for the treatment of FA in the U.S. based on the MOXIe Part 2 study results; and (iii) as a result, the Company\u2019s public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. On August 10, 2020, during pre-market hours, Reata issued a press release announcing its second quarter 2020 financial results, wherein it disclosed that the FDA \u201cis not convinced that the MOXIe Part 2 results\u201d of the Company\u2019s study assessing omaveloxolone for the treatment of FA \u201cwill support a single study approval without additional evidence that lends persuasiveness to the results,\u201d and that, \u201c[i]n preliminary comments for [a] meeting, the FDA stated that [Defendants] will need to conduct a second pivotal trial that confirms the mFARS [modified Friedreich\u2019s Ataxia Rating Scale] results of the MOXIe Part 2 study with a similar magnitude of effect.\u201d On this news, Reata\u2019s stock price fell $51.79 per share, or 33.16%, to close at $104.41 per share on August 10, 2020.

Only six days remains until the  lead plaintiff deadline in a securities fraud class action that has been filed against the company and senior executives.

The case seeks to recover damages caused by Defendants\u2019 violations of the federal securities laws and to pursue remedies under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the \"Exchange Act\") and Rule\u00a010b-5 promulgated thereunder, against the Company and certain of its top officials. If you are a shareholder who purchased VXRT shares during the class period, you have until\u00a0Oct. 23, 2020, to ask the Court to appoint you as Lead Plaintiff for the class.\u00a0 A copy of the Complaint can be obtained  . \u00a0  . Vaxart is a clinical-stage Company purportedly engaged in the discovery and development of vaccines for a variety of diseases that would be administered orally, rather than by injection. The class action arises from Defendants\u2019 alleged fraudulent scheme to profit from artificially inflating the Company\u2019s stock price by announcing false and misleading information concerning Vaxart\u2019s oral COVID-19 vaccine candidate. Specifically, the Complaint alleges that on June 26, 2020, Vaxart issued a press release entitled, \u201cVaxart\u2019s COVID-19 Vaccine Selected for the U.S. Government\u2019s Operation Warp Speed,\u201d falsely claiming its vaccine had been selected to participate in a non-human challenge study, organized and funded by OWS. This announcement sent the price of Vaxart shares rocketing higher. In furtherance of the scheme, Defendants amended controlling shareholder Armistice\u2019s existing warrant agreements, allowing Armistice to exercise all of its warrants immediately and sell 27.6 million Vaxart shares, reaping profits of approximately $200 million.\u00a0\u00a0 Defendants also issued millions of dollars in favorable stock options to Vaxart\u2019s most senior executives. The Complaint alleges that on July 25, 2020, details emerged revealing Defendants\u2019 deception concerning their alleged pump and dump scheme. In particular, on July 25, 2020,  published an article entitled, \u201cCorporate Insiders Pocket $1 Billion in Rush for Coronavirus Vaccine,\u201d covering suspiciously timed stock bets that had generated significant profits for senior executives and board members at companies developing vaccines and treatments. Vaxart was featured prominently in the article, and it clarified \u201cVaxart is not among the companies selected to receive significant financial support from Warp Speed.\u201d In response to this news, the price of Vaxart shares dropped sharply lower on July 27, 2020 from $12.29 to $11.16. , Vaxart revealed it   in connection with the U.S. Attorney\u2019s office investigation into Vaxart\u2019s disclosures of its participation in Operation Warp Speed, options grants, warrant transactions and other corporate and financing matters.  Vaxart revealed   the same matters. This news sent the price of Vaxart shares crashing lower. \u201cWe\u2019re focused on investors\u2019 losses and proving Vaxart misled investors about OWS\u2019s potential funding support for the Company,\u201d said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman partner leading the investigation.
