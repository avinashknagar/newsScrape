The survey was conducted in September in conjunction with the World Travel & Tourism Council (WTTC), which represents the global Travel & Tourism private sector.A clear majority of US and Canadian travelers (70 percent) say they plan to take a vacation in 2021.\nResults indicate that 45 percent of respondents have already made plans or are starting to make finite plans for their next vacation, while 54 percent say they are dreaming of when they can travel again.\"These are really strong numbers. The fact that 99 percent of travelers surveyed said they are planning a trip or looking forward to the time they can travel again indicates that as concerns about COVID-19 are addressed, leisure travelers will lead the recovery,\" said , President of Travel Leaders Group.In the survey, 23 percent of respondents said they plan to travel by the end of 2020, 70 percent said they will travel in 2021 with just 18 percent saying they will resume traveling in 2022.\"Consumer uncertainty about the risk of exposure or concerns about being quarantined is a core problem,\" said , WTTC President & CEO. \"With rapid testing to replace quarantine requirements, enhanced contact tracing and industry-wide standards by sector that can be clearly communicated to the public, we can help alleviate many of those concerns.\" The willingness of Americans to travel can be seen in the slow, but steady, increase in the Transportation Security Administration's (TSA) daily screening numbers, which fell below 90,000 a day in April and are now approaching 1 million a day at peak periods. In 2019, TSA daily traveler counts averaged between 2.3 and 2.7 million passengers a day.More than half of travelers surveyed say they are concerned about the risk of being infected when traveling on a plane or cruise ship, getting stuck while away from home or being quarantined on a cruise ship or at a hotel. A lesser number named concerns about them or a family member contracting the virus while traveling, worries about getting a refund if the trip is cancelled, and concerns about family members with higher risk health conditions.A majority of survey respondents said the following health and safety initiatives at airports, aboard aircraft and at resorts will make a big difference in their decision to travel in the future: mandatory masks, social distancing, enhanced cleaning, temperature checks and access to sanitizing gel. For resorts, contact-free services and customizable room cleaning were also cited.\"Our industry needs to do more to inform potential travelers about all of the health and safety protocols that have been implemented across the industry and continue to standardize those protocols to restore consumer confidence in travel,\" said Lovell. \"Airlines, airports and cruise lines have made major strides in the health and hygiene measures they have taken in close consultation with the world's leading medical experts. We need to share that story with the traveling public.\"Nearly 60 percent of respondents said the requirement of a negative PCR test prior to arrival in a destination would make no difference or would be viewed as a positive, while about 40 percent said such a requirement would be a deterrent. Those concerns can be addressed with rapid testing, Lovell said. \"We believe the widespread availability of rapid testing will result in greater acceptance of pre-trip testing and encourage more people to travel,\" he stated.Most of those surveyed who said they plan to take a vacation said they will fly to their next vacation destination (47 percent), 21 percent will drive, 17 percent said they plan to take an ocean cruise, with 5 percent opting for a river cruise.\"We continue to see strong interest in domestic travel, beach destinations and less crowded destinations in both the US and , while the popularity of  across the board is encouraging,\" said , Chief Marketing Officer for Travel Leaders Group. (38 percent), the  (34 percent) and  (15 percent) are the top-ranked international destinations of interest, followed by  (for US travelers), Central and , ,  and .For US travelers, uncrowded, outdoor and beach experiences topped the list of desired domestic destinations, with National Parks, , , ,  and \"anywhere uncrowded\" high on the list while traditionally popular sites, such as  and , scored lower.For Canadians, , , , , \"anywhere uncrowded\" and National Parks led the list. The survey results are validated by Travel Leaders Group's online inquiries. Online leads declined in late March, reaching a low point on  then peaking on . Following a second outbreak of COVID-19 in some areas, leads dropped again and are now on the upswing, up 88 percent from the low in April, McGillivray said.Close-in booking windows are a trend among online shoppers. The majority of consumers reaching out online want to travel by the year's end 2020, followed by January/, spring and summer. Milestone birthdays, anniversaries and honeymoons are popular reasons to travel. Camper vans and home and villa rentals are in high demand.Many come seeking the expert advice of a travel advisor. Here's a sampling of the inquiries:\"Booking with a travel advisor is the best possible strategy to navigate the new world of travel,\" McGillivray said. \"They can provide all the facts you need to know about destinations, requirements, how to protect your purchase, and best of all, they provide peace of mind.\"Travel Leaders Group, a division of Internova Travel Group, encompasses the franchise and consortia operations, host agency business and brands predominantly focused on leisure, cruise and tour.

Those who inquire by e-mail are encouraged to include their mailing address, telephone number, and the number of shares purchased.\u00a0 \u00a0GoHealth provides an end-to-end health insurance marketplace that purportedly specializes in matching consumers with Medicare Advantage plans.\u00a0 Based in , GoHealth is organized as a holding company, with GoHealth Holdings, LLC (\"GHH\") as the Company's principal asset, which houses the Company's operations. GHH was formerly known as Blizzard Parent, LLC (\"Blizzard\"), until it was acquired by the private equity firm Centerbridge (defined below) in  for  in equity and cash (the \"Acquisition\").\u00a0 In connection with the Acquisition, Centerbridge also agreed to pay the Company's selling shareholders up to  worth of additional contingent consideration, to be paid in the form of common and senior preferred earnout units, if the Company achieved certain earnings targets in late 2019 and 2020.Immediately following the Acquisition, GoHealth reported tremendous growth.\u00a0 From , through , GoHealth purportedly generated  in net revenues, compared to just  during the period from , through , 2019.\u00a0 Thus, GoHealth stated that it had generated substantially more revenues in the three-and-a-half months following the Acquisition than in the eight-and-a-half months preceding the Acquisition.\u00a0 Indeed, GoHealth claimed to have generated more revenues in the three-and-a-half months following the Acquisition than it did during the Company's entire 2018 fiscal year.GoHealth also represented that its business model was highly profitable, offering the best lifetime value of commissions (\"LTV\") per consumer acquisition cost (\"CAC\") of any of its peers.\u00a0 LTV refers to the commission revenues that GoHealth expected to receive from insurance carriers in connection with an approved submission for an insurance policy by a new consumer over time, factoring in a variety of variables such as contracted commission rates, carrier mix, policy persistency, and the number of expected submissions.\u00a0 CAC refers to the cost to GoHealth of acquiring its consumers.\u00a0 Thus, LTV/CAC is a type of profitability metric that generally refers to how much of a return GoHealth expected on its consumer acquisition investments.\u00a0 GoHealth represented that its LTV/CAC ratio for its Medicare Internal segment (the Company's largest and most profitable segment) was 3.9x and 2.7x for 2019 and its first-quarter 2020, respectively, significantly higher than the 1.7x LTV/CAC ratio the Company stated it had achieved during the first quarter of 2019 and, by some estimates, roughly double GoHealth's peers.Although GoHealth generated net losses in 2019, the Company claimed that this was because it was in growth mode and seeking to expand its presence as a dominant force in the Medicare insurance marketplace.\u00a0 The Company's adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (\"EBITDA\")\u2014a metric tailored by management ostensibly to show the Company's core profitability by excluding certain costs\u2014increased considerably in the lead-up to the IPO.\u00a0 GoHealth claimed that its adjusted EBITDA had grown by 388% year over year to  during its pro forma 2019 and by 394% year over year to  during the first quarter of 2020.\u00a0 As a result of its apparently exceptional earnings growth, GoHealth incurred  in contingent consideration liability from the close of the Acquisition through the end of the first quarter of 2020 to be paid out to the Company's prior owners.Unlike many competitors, the Company focused its business on just two insurance carriers: Humana and Anthem.\u00a0 In the first quarter of 2020, 74% of GoHealth's entire net revenues were derived from just these two carriers.\u00a0 This carrier concentration was even higher for GoHealth's all-important Medicare segments at roughly 85% of all segment revenues, despite the fact that Humana and Anthem were estimated to account for just 23% of total Medicare Advantage market-wide enrollment.GoHealth considers insurance carriers to be its primary customers, rather than consumers because the carriers are responsible for paying commissions to GoHealth in exchange for GoHealth reliably placing policies in compliance with applicable regulations and carrier-specific requirements.\u00a0 The Company does not receive any revenues directly from consumers.\u00a0 The carriers utilize GoHealth as a scalable means of acquiring customers that can be more cost-effective than developing internal acquisition capabilities.\u00a0 According to GoHealth, the Company's high LTV/CAC ratio was primarily the result of the Company's unique competitive advantages in the services it provides to its insurance carrier partners.\u00a0 As described by the Company, GoHealth's \"Best-in-Class Medicare LTV/CAC Ratio\" is \"Driven by Proprietary Technology, Business Processes, Data and Highly Skilled Agents.\"On , just nine months after the Acquisition, GoHealth filed with the SEC a registration statement for the IPO on Form S-1, which, after two amendments, was declared effective on  (the \"Registration Statement\").\u00a0 On , GoHealth filed with the SEC a prospectus for the IPO on Form 424B4, which incorporated and formed part of the Registration Statement.\u00a0 The Registration Statement was used to sell to the investing public 43.5 million shares of GoHealth Class A common stock at  per share, for total gross proceeds of .\u00a0 Proceeds from the IPO were used primarily for the purpose of paying the Company's insiders and Centerbridge and consummating financial obligations which had arisen from the Acquisition.The Complaint alleges that the Registration Statement for the IPO was negligently prepared and, as a result, contained untrue statements of material fact, omitted material facts necessary to make the statements contained therein not misleading, and failed to make necessary disclosures required under the rules and regulations governing its preparation.\u00a0 Specifically, the Registration Statement failed to disclose that at the time of the IPO: (i) the Medicare insurance industry was undergoing a period of elevated churn, which had begun in the first half of 2020; (ii) GoHealth suffered from a higher risk of customer churn as a result of its unique business model and limited carrier base; (iii) GoHealth suffered from degradations in customer persistency and retention as a result of elevated industry churn, vulnerabilities that arose from the Company's concentrated carrier business model, and GoHealth's efforts to expand into new geographies, develop new carrier partnerships and worsening product mix; (iv) GoHealth had entered into materially less favorable revenue-sharing arrangements with its external sales agents; and (v) these adverse financial and operational trends were internally projected by GoHealth to continue and worsen following the IPO.Shortly after the IPO, the price of GoHealth Class A common stock suffered significant price declines, and by , GoHealth Class A common stock closed at just  per share\u2014over 40% below the  per share price investors paid for the stock in the IPO less than two months previously.The Pomerantz Firm, with offices in , , , and  is acknowledged as one of the premier firms in the areas of

Consumer, privacy and good government groups leading the opposition include the ACLU, the League of Women Voters of , Consumer Federation of , the California Alliance for Retired Americans, Consumer Action, Public Citizen, Californians for Privacy Now and the Center for Digital Democracy.Prop 24's wealthy sponsor met behind closed doors with Facebook and high tech lobbyists while he was drafting this so-called \"privacy\" initiative. Tech companies are silent on Prop 24. The  editorial opposing Prop 24 concludes that tech giants do not consider Prop 24 a threat to their privacy-invading practices.Consumer and privacy groups object to Proposition 24's approval of Pay for Privacy schemes, its elimination of privacy rights when Californians travel outside the state, and its changes to current law that make it more cumbersome for consumers to stop corporations from selling their confidential personal data. Advocates for vulnerable communities are alarmed that Proposition 24 will create privacy haves and have-nots. Millions of Californians who are struggling during a pandemic and high unemployment cannot afford to pay more to secure their privacy. They will be forced to choose between good online connections without privacy, or inferior internet access if they assert their privacy rights. \u00a0Prop 24 also omits immigration status as a category of confidential information, and it eliminates the right of individuals to delete information posted on Facebook or other social media platforms, which exposes immigrants to greater risk of intimidation and deportation.Color of Change, labor and civil rights leader , The Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights (CHIRLA), Black Lives Matter Los Angeles, the California Environmental Justice Alliance and other advocates for low income persons, immigrants and communities of color oppose Prop 24.Unions opposing Prop 24 include the California Nurses Association and Communications Workers of America District 9, AFL-CIO.\u00a0 Prop 24 delays the right of workers to find out what personal information unrelated to work performance employers are secretly collecting.At the same time, Prop 24 is a costly burden on small business. \u00a0Businesses are already spending as much as  to comply with a new privacy law that became fully operational on , according to a report released by the California Department of Finance. It is too early to know how well this brand new privacy law is working and what needs to be fixed. Prop 24 will impose a new round of compliance costs at a time that many smaller businesses are barely surviving a severe economic downturn. The California Small Business Association, the Orange County Business Council, Chambers of  in , , and , and other small business groups oppose Prop 24. The  editorial opposing Prop 24 states \"It's too soon to redo  current internet privacy law.\"Big tech companies are likely to gain an unfair advantage, as Prop 24's costs are a handicap to any potential new competition.  editorial opposing Prop 24 notes that \"Never again will tech giants be threatened by a start-up company in somebody's garage.\"Also uniting this diverse coalition of Prop 24 opponents are grave concerns with its restrictions that make it next impossible for lawmakers to correct its flaws or to strengthen privacy rights. This concern is echoed by legal scholars and editorials opposing Prop 24 in the , the  and other daily newspapers.  wrote that Prop 24 \"is designed to calcify a particular (and relatively weak) mode of privacy protection.\"Learn more at \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0SOURCE Californians for Real Privacy - No on Proposition 24 "}
