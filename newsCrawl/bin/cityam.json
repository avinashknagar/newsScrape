The Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (Beis) committee is probing the extent to which businesses in the UK are exploiting the forced labour of persecuted Uyghur Muslims at work camps in the Xinjiang region of China. It has been estimated that 1m Uyghur Muslims are being held in internment camps in the northern Chinese province. The committee has written to 14 firms to question them over potential supply chain links to slave labour in the region, including Gap, Ikea, Zara and M&S. It has also asked sportswear brands Adidas, Nike and Puma to give evidence, as well as upmarket brands Victoria\u2019s Secret, Stella McCartney and the North Face. Tiktok and the Walt Disney Company are also among the companies that have been summoned to be quizzed by the committee over slave labour at a public hearing on 5 November. The letters include questions around supply-chain transparency and ask the firms for evidence of compliance with labour, procurement and anti-slavery laws. Nusrat Ghani MP, the lead BEIS committee member for the inquiry, said : \u201cThese businesses are trusted by many British consumers and I hope they will repay this faith by coming forward to answer these questions and also take up the opportunity to give evidence to the Business Committee in public. \u201cThere have been a series of accounts of products being sold in the UK which can be traced back to forced labour at camps in China. \u201cOn the BEIS Committee, we want to get a clearer sense of the extent of this problem, how seriously businesses ask questions of their own supply and value-chains, and to also examine the steps both government and business could take to ensure that businesses and consumers in the UK do not perpetuate the forced labour of Uyghur.\u201d"},

Research published today by the Investment Association (IA) showed that 98 per cent of FTSE 100 companies analysed have now either aligned the pension payouts of directors with that of their workforce or committed to doing so.\u00a0 The figure marks a  , when just three in 10 FTSE 100 companies pledged to cut their executives\u2019 pension payments as part of the 2019 annual general meeting (AGM) season. The hike comes as companies bowed to shareholder pressure to align their pension packages \u201cas an issue of fairness and to foster good employee relations\u201d, the IA said. Research showed that 14 companies listed on the FTSE 100 index reduced pension contributions for existing directors during the year, while a further 43 committed to reduce contributions in the near future. Six FTSE 100 companies said they will increase their workforce rate as part of efforts to align pension contributions across their business. Lord Callanan, parliamentary under secretary for the Department for Business, said: \u201cNo executive should be building up an exorbitant pension fund far and above the majority of their workforce, particularly during this testing time. \u201cI am really pleased to see the progress the vast majority of FTSE 100 companies have made towards bringing their executive pension contributions in line with the wider workforce, and would urge each and every business on the list to ensure plans are in place by 2022.\u201d It comes as the UK\u2019s top companies have faced mounting pressure to axe the disparity between pension payments awarded to executives and more junior staff members. Standard Chartered\u2019s chief executive Bill Withers last year came under fire for telling the Financial Times shareholders were \u201cimmature\u201d for focusing on his pension arrangements. However, the IA noted that there was still progress to be made, with 10 companies on the index being issued a red-top for having at least one existing director receiving a pension contribution of 25 per cent or more with no commitment to align this with the rest of the workforce by the end of 2022.\u00a0 A further two companies were issued a red-top for not committing to align the pension contributions of new directors with that of the workforce. IA chief executive Chris Cummings said:\u201cProviding directors with the same pension contributions as the rest of the workforce is fundamentally an issue of fairness. \u201cGiven the economic difficulties many people across the UK are facing, it is only right that the majority of FTSE 100 companies are now aligning their executive pension contributions with their workforce.\u201d"},

I have a weekend cafe on Columbia Road and make creative cakes and pastries to order for home delivery, weddings and events, as well as consulting for other brands and businesses. My team were on furlough and my shop was closed, with all our weddings and events cancelled but I wanted to be able to stay open, so I baked solo, making little cakes for home delivery. I was able to spend time focussing on streamlining the business to make it more efficient and redesigned much of the menu. It was actually a really good thing to have so much time free to focus on looking at the business and how it could be improved, and good for my mental health to be baking for other people rather than locked down at home. It\u2019s tragic to see so many people losing work and businesses closing up and down the country. Our business is still hugely affected and we anticipate a slower than usual Christmas, but my overheads aren\u2019t huge and I have been able to weather the storm so far. I\u2019m most apprehensive that the next few months will see a lot of irreparable damage done to our economy. I\u2019m hopeful we could survive. I adapted the business significantly over the last 6 months; growing the home delivery side and online ordering to try to compensate for some of the losses to footfall and events. The furlough scheme and grant helped enormously and I was able to save some jobs. The early closure of shops, restaurants and markets during stricter lockdown periods seems counterintuitive \u2013 if you want to prevent people from overcrowding and spreading the virus it would be better to have longer opening hours so people can avoid congestion, while keeping more people in employment in those sectors. It would be great to see the government discussing measures with leaders in the industry about what works. A lot of my restaurant experiences since lockdown have been pretty normal, even with new regulations in place, so I\u2019m hopeful we can snap back to life as we knew it before. However, the wider impact on the industry is going to be huge, with so many cuts and closures that our industry will be substantially changed. I imagine 2021 is going to be a rocky ride. On a personal level it\u2019s afforded me a lot of time to practise and improve my skills in the kitchen, which has been a gift. I\u2019ve realised the importance of an online presence for the business and learned how to better manage that and use my platforms to support myself and others in the industry.

A real focus on the quality of the ingredients, and a real focus on maintaining high standards.\u201d It tastes like it.

It just puts a flavour into a pizza that you don\u2019t get from an electric or gas.\u201d Those ovens fell cold, of course, in the dark days of March and April.

The site was open within 24 hours, with takeout pizza flying out the window and even a takeout pint available.\u00a0 The \u2018take and bake\u2019 pizza, too, is now available nationwide.

You\u2019d have to do a lot more to it than this to kill it.\u201d As City A.M. emerges back onto the street, three office workers brave the rain and sprint across the road to the pub.

A spokesperson for TfL said: \u201cWe have today agreed with the government that our funding will be extended for two weeks so that these constructive discussions can be concluded.\u201d In May the Department for Transport handed TfL a \u00a31.6bn bailout as the nationwide lockdown crippled revenue for the capital\u2019s rail network. TfL this week  , after London mayor Sadiq Khan warned the government cash would run out on 17 October. Khan has asked the government for a further \u00a35.65bn for TfL over the next 18 months, as Covid restrictions and the Prime Minister\u2019s orders to \u201cwork from home where possible\u201d continue to weigh on Tube and bus passenger numbers. The operator\u2019s income plummeted 90 per cent between March and July, with footfall from July to October only rising marginally. London is set to face   as the capital moves from Tier 1 to Tier 2 at midnight tonight. The new \u201chigh\u201d alert level will mean a ban on households mixing indoors, while Londoners will be told to avoid public transport where possible. It comes after a source in the mayor\u2019s office last week told\u00a0 that around City Hall there was a \u201cvague sense that [negotiations] are f****d\u201d, and that TfL was at a major risk of running out of cash. Eleventh-hour talks between the mayor and ministers have stalled because of sticking points surrounding the government\u2019s demands for a potential bailout. The mayor is understood to have rejected conditions including an expansion of the congestion zone to the North and South Circular, and a demand for fare hikes across the Tube network. The government is also said to want to axe free travel initiatives for children and those over the age of 60 as part of a potential \u00a31bn bailout. A spokesperson for TfL said: \u201cWe continue to discuss our funding requirements with the government and hope these discussions can be concluded successfully soon, so we can help London through the next phase of the pandemic.\u201d"}
