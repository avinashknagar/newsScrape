Mr. Poutiainen received the National Entrepreneur Award in the annual meeting of the Federation of Finnish Enterprises in Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4 on 17  October. The award is given every year to four Finnish entrepreneurs as a recognition of exceptional entrepreneurship.  Picosun provides ALD (Atomic Layer Deposition) thin film coating solutions to global microelectronics and other industries. ALD was invented in Finland in 1974 by Picosun Board Member Dr. Tuomo Suntola, who in 2018 received the Millennium Technology Prize in recognition of his invention. ALD is a mature, key enabling technology in today\u2019s semiconductor manufacturing, realizing the development of modern microelectronics according to the Moore\u2019s Law. ALD is expanding rapidly to other fields of industry as well, and it is expected to bring a fundamental disruption especially to healthcare technologies, where Picosun\u2019s PicoMEDICAL\u2122 solutions have already enabled several new innovations.  \u201cEven if we had great premises to start manufacturing ALD equipment, not everyone believed in us in the beginning. Our personnel did and showed what they are capable of. It has taken us to a path of excellent growth,\u201d says Poutiainen. Picosun\u2019s first customers, when the company entered the ALD business in 2004, were universities and research institutes. Now, the world\u2019s leading electronics manufacturers and other companies turn to Picosun when they need the most advanced thin film coating technology to stay spearheading their own industries. Even in the middle of the global pandemic, Picosun\u2019s turnover is expected to grow 50%, which is remarkably higher than the market\u2019s average of 15%. \u201cSince day one, our vision was to be the best in the world. We have already achieved this with our R&D ALD tools, and now we are heading further. We invest a significant amount of our turnover in development of our ALD solutions and our personnel so that we can always exceed the expectations of our customers. It is an honor to receive the National Entrepreneurship Award of Finland, and it is an honor to be a part in steering Picosun towards the future, which looks very bright indeed,\u201d continues Poutiainen. \u201cThe whole Picosun team wants to congratulate our Chairman, Kustaa Poutiainen, on this prestigious award. We are very proud of his significant contributions and role in enabling the international breakthrough of Finnish originated ALD technology. I am sure that the entire global ALD community appreciates his efforts and joins our congratulations,\u201d summarizes Mr. Jussi Rautee, CEO of Picosun Group. \nMr. Jussi Rautee \nCEO, Picosun Group \nTel: +358 50\u00a0345 4457 \nEmail:  info@picosun.com \nWeb:  www.picosun.com"},

Sobi\u2122  today presented results from the sensitivity analysis from the pivotal phase 2/3 study (NCT01818492) of emapalumab in patients with primary HLH at the 19th meeting of the European Society of Immunodeficiencies (ESID). Analyses of the efficacy of emapalumab in primary HLH utilising various definitions of treatment response all support the study primary endpoint of a 63 per cent overall response rate (ORR) in patients with insufficient response to standard of care, as published in NEJM in May 2020 . \u201cThis analysis confirms the methodology and use of clinically objective response criteria in the pivotal study assessing treatment efficacy of emapalumab in primary HLH, where there are currently no validated endpoints for efficacy assessment\u201d said Ravi Rao, Head of R&D and Chief Medical Officer at Sobi. \u201cWe remain committed to making emapalumab accessible to patients affected by this severe condition around the world.\u201d A high unmet medical need exists among these patients despite today\u2019s standard-of-care therapy, glucocorticoids and etoposide, with or without cyclosporine. Conventional therapies are associated with adverse events as cytotoxicity and opportunistic infections, and no decrease in mortality has been shown in the past 20 years using the current standard-of-care therapies.  No standard approach to measuring response rate to treatment has been established due to the rarity of the disease. The pivotal study used clinically objective response criteria to define the primary endpoint of overall response rate to emapalumab in primary HLH. The sensitivity analysis supports the use of the clinically objective ORR as a primary endpoint in studies of primary HLH. Emapalumab is the first therapy approved by the US Food & Drug Administration (FDA) for primary HLH. Emapalumab is under review by the European Medicines Agency (EMA). About emapalumab  Emapalumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to and neutralises interferon gamma (IFN\u03b3). In the US, emapalumab is indicated for the treatment of adult and paediatric (new-born and older) patients with primary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) with refractory, recurrent or progressive disease or intolerance with conventional HLH therapy.  P rimary HLH  is  a rare syndrome of hyperinflammation that usually occurs within the first year of life and can rapidly become fatal unless diagnosed and treated. The FDA approval is based on data from the phase 2/3 studies (NCT01818492 and  NCT02069899 ). Emapalumab is indicated for administration through intravenous infusion over one hour twice per week until haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). For more information please see www.gamifant.com including the full US Prescribing Information. Emapalumab is under review for primary HLH by the European Medicines Agency (EMA). In September 2020, emapalumab received Orphan Drug Designation (ODD) by the FDA for prevention of graft failure following haematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

In addition, due to considerable progress in the investment process, ELG and its principal shareholders have reached an agreement with the Bondholder Committee on a standstill period extension to accommodate the timeframe required to complete the investment process with any one of the potential investors.  ELG hereby informs that the standstill period is extended to accommodate the investment process deadlines with a requirement to sign binding investment agreement by mid-December at the latest and full closing of transaction in January 2021 at the latest. Furthermore, subject to the conditions of the Standstill Letter, including the conditions for the extension of the standstill period, the Bondholder Committee has confirmed that it will not instruct the Agent to accelerate the Bonds and/or enforce the Transaction Security under the Terms and Conditions or the Security Documents, as applicable, due to (in addition to the defaults mentioned in the press release from 30 July 2020): the Company\u2019s failure to comply with the Maintenance Test requirements for the third and fourth quarter 2020, which will constitute Event of Defaults under Clause 14.2 (Maintenance Test); and the Company\u2019s failure to pay Interest in respect of the Bonds in accordance with paragraph (b) of Clause 8 on the Interest Payment Date for the Interest Period ending on 22 November 2020 which will constitute and Event of Default under Clause 14.1 (Non-payment).
