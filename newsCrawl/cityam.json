Ginsburg passed away at her home in Washington on Friday, surrounded by her family, following a battle with metastatic pancreatic cancer, the statement said. She was the oldest justice and just second woman to ever sit on the Supreme Court, having been appointed in 1993. The prominent feminist and figurehead for liberals revealed she was undergoing chemotherapy earlier this year, following a recurrence of cancer. \u201cOur Nation has lost a jurist of historic stature,\u201d Chief Justice John Roberts said in a statement on Friday. \u201cWe at the Supreme Court have lost a cherished colleague. Today we mourn, but with confidence that future generations will remember Ruth Bader Ginsburg as we knew her \u2013 a tireless and resolute champion of justice.\u201d Ginsburg was one of four liberals on the justice court. Her death raises the possibility of US President Donald Trump trying to expand the slender conservative majority on the court ahead of November\u2019s election. He is expected to appoint nominate a conservative replacement as soon as possible. Presidential candidate Joe Biden has said the appointment should be made after the US election. And Ginsburg expressed her strong disapproval of Trump making such a move in the days before her death. \u201cMy most fervent wish is that I will not be replaced until a new president is installed,\u201d she wrote in a statement to her granddaughter,\u00a0 . Reacting to the news of Ginsburg\u2019s death following a rally in Minnesota, Trump said: \u201cI didn\u2019t know that.

London\u2019s main stock index fell 0.5 per cent to 6,017 points at 3pm. Mid-cap firms were hit harder, with the FTSE 250 dropping one per cent. On Wall Street, the Nasdaq index slipped 0.1 per cent, continuing a now three-day decline in big tech stocks. The S&P 500 fell 0.3 per cent and the Dow Jones was down 0.4 per cent. Europe\u2019s continent-wide Stoxx 600 rose 0.4 per cent, however. Germany\u2019s Dax was down 0.1 per cent and the French CAC 40 had fallen 0.9 per cent. The downward shift came as investors digested the resurgence of coronavirus around the world. Global cases topped 30m yesterday. And countries from France to South Korea are frantically fighting the virus they once thought they had under control. Investors have also been left somewhat disappointed by the US Federal Reserve, which did not signal any further easing on Wednesday. For the moment, the global economic recovery is still faring well.   investors today digested data that showed   again in August, and now stand four per cent higher than before Covid. Yet the potential for further lockdowns hammered travel stocks. Health secretary Matt Hancock today said he did not rule out another lockdown, although he said it was not being planned. British Airways-owner IAG was the biggest faller on the FTSE 100, plunging 11.6 per cent. Jet engine-maker Rolls Royce shed 4.4 per cent and Intercontinental Hotels fell 4.5 per cent. \u201cAmid growing chatter about a potential two-week nationwide lockdown in October in the UK, it was perhaps no surprise to see investors lose interest in stocks that could be negatively affected by such activity,\u201d said Russ Mould, investment director at broker AJ Bell. UK banks also took a hit after the Bank of England yesterday said it was working out how it would implement negative interest rates should they be needed. Lower interest rates damage banks\u2019 profitability. The FTSE 350 banks index slumped to its lowest level in almost three decades. Investors have dumped bank stocks, worried about coronavirus loans to companies and record-low interest rates. The pound was down 0.2 per cent against the dollar at $1.295. It has had a volatile few weeks as Brexit has returned to the headlines. It was not all bad on the FTSE 100, however. The rise in retail sales in August helped Sainsbury\u2019s shares climb 2.1 per cent and Tesco\u2019s rise one per cent. Wall Street has had a torrid three weeks after investors second-guessed the recent stellar rally in tech stocks and hit the sell button. Investors were left underwhelmed by the US Federal Reserve meeting on Wednesday, after chair Jay Powell did not signal any more stimulus was imminent. Stocks sold off despite the Fed improving its economic forecasts for the US. Also on traders\u2019 minds is the lack of progress between Republicans and Democrats over the next round of fiscal stimulus. \u201cWhat\u2019s more, tech stocks \u2013 which were a driving force behind the outstanding stock market comeback \u2013 remain shaky and vulnerable to more downside,\u201d said Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at currency firm Oanda."},

Interest rates were left at 0.1 per cent and bond-buying at \u00a3745bn in a business-as-usual decision. All nine members of the monetary policy committee (MPC) voted in favour of continuing this monetary policy. But analysts, investors and traders continued to hotly debate how the Bank will proceed in the coming months.   The Bank was relatively upbeat about the economy, saying the recovery had been \u201ca little stronger\u201d than expected. However, it warned that coronavirus could knock it off course. Most of the talk after yesterday\u2019s decision was about negative interest rates. The meeting\u2019s minutes showed that the MPC discussed how they could be implemented, should the economy need them. They also said the BoE will begin \u201cstructured engagement\u201d with the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) on \u201cpolicy considerations\u201d in the fourth quarter. Here\u2019s what economists and analysts made of the Bank\u2019s latest meeting. The pound slid yesterday after the meeting\u2019s minutes showed that the Bank was taking the possibility of negative interest rates relatively seriously. However, chief UK economist at Oxford Economics Andrew Goodwin said, the \u201cstructured engagement\u201d with the PRA was nothing more than a formality. \u201cThat the BoE is merely beginning to consult on the implications of negative rates confirms this is not an active policy option in the near-term,\u201d he said.\u00a0 Yet Nigel Green, founder and chief executive of De Vere Group, took the minutes more seriously. He said that personal financial strategies should be reviewed to ensure they are \u201cnegative interest rate ready\u201d. \u201cThis would have been unimaginable even a few months ago. But the shifts have been seismic this year.\u201d Andrew Wishart, UK economist at consultancy Capital Economics, expected quantitative easing (QE) to \u201cremain the tool of choice\u201d for months ahead. Under QE, the Bank creates money and buys government and corporate bonds to keep borrowing costs low. \u201cThe Bank will only start working out how to put negative rates into practice in the fourth quarter,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd even then it will remain concerned about their effectiveness when banks are absorbing loan losses.\u201d The   its fast data had shown the UK\u2019s economic recovery was stronger than it had predicted in August. \u201cConsumption has continued to recover during the summer and is now at around its start-of-year level in aggregate,\u201d it said. Jacqui Douglas, macro strategist at TD Securities, said the statement was \u201cmore upbeat than we had expected\u201d. She said that reflected \u201ca slightly stronger rebound into the third quarter\u201d. Douglas also flagged that there was \u201cno mention of the risks to growth into 2021, which is where some MPC members had expressed a lot more concern\u201d. However, the Bank cautioned that the spread of Covid in the UK and Europe could knock the recovery off track. Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said: \u201cThe members seemed wary of the downside risks to the recovery, stemming from rising coronavirus cases.\u201d He pointed out that \u201cthe possibility of persistently high unemployment\u201d was also one of the Bank\u2019s worries. The Bank gave little indication that it plans to boost stimulus in November. But many analysts predict it will increase its bond-buying target as demand built up during lockdown peters out. Wishart said he predicted \u201cmore than the consensus expects\u201d. He said: \u201cWe\u2019ve pencilled in an extra \u00a3250bn of QE over the course of the next year, with an instalment of \u00a3100bn in November.\u201d Pantheon Macroeconomics\u2019 chief UK economist Samuel Tombs said: \u201cOur view remains that the MPC will authorise a further \u00a350bn of asset purchases before the end of this year, and then a further \u00a350bn of purchases in the first quarter [of 2021].\u201d"},

The Independent Sage committee of scientists, chaired by former chief scientific adviser Sir David King, has issued a report to caution government of an upcoming crisis if it cannot get a handle on the infection rate. It recommended that the government take drastic measures to avoid a second national lockdown, such as the immediate suspension of indoor service in pubs and restaurants. Other emergency proposals included: The committee said a thousand of lives could be saved if the government can double the efficacy of the NHS Test and Trace scheme from 16 per cent to 32 per cent, but that it must happen immediately. Karl Friston, a neuroscientist at University College London, said current assumptions that the government has to reach 80 per cent of contacts for every infected person may be \u201cfundamentally misguided\u201d. \u201cDynamic causal modelling shows a simple doubling of contact tracing efficacy\u2026 would\u00a0bend the curve\u00a0\u2014 and save about 1,000 lives,\u201d he said alongside the report\u2019s release. Friston said the government should re-focus the Test and Trace scheme towards using local public health teams to find, monitor and support traced persons, rather than staffing remote call centres. \u201cThe headline from the quantitative modelling of recent trends in new cases is clear: now is the time for \u2018shoe-leather\u2019 epidemiology,\u201d he said. \u201cCrucially, this kind of contact tracing can only be done effectively using local knowledge (e.g. cultural aspects), expertise and detective work.\u201d Friston added that such an approach would reduce the demand for tests, which could be better used for testing those without symptoms who have come into contact with a confirmed case. The report comes as the UK\u2019s coronavirus testing infrastructure is reaching its breaking point, as thousands are left unable to book a test in their local area.

Health secretary Matt Hancock said today that he could not rule out another nationwide lockdown. He said it was not currently being planned, however. The reproduction rate is the average number of infections produced by an infected person. For example, if R is two, then each infected person infects two more people. Keeping the R rate below one is crucial to controlling the pandemic. In England, the R rate was between 1.2 and 1.4, the government said.

Prenetics chief executive Avi Lasarow told  the technology could provide the government with key data to help it adapt the UK\u2019s coronavirus response. \u201cWe think that testing is akin to wearing a seatbelt in a car,\u201d he said. \u201cWithout a doubt testing is going to play a major role in our everyday lives until such a time as a vaccine.\u201d It comes as the government faces growing criticism over its testing system, with shortages forcing some Brits to travel hundreds of miles to get tested. Lasarow said the UK had built an effective centralised model for testing, but its reliance on laboratories had caused bottlenecks and limited scalability. \u201cI think they\u2019ve done a great job to get us where we are but their strategy needs to evolve to include the private sector,\u201d he said. Prenetics said its new Covid-19 test was low-cost and did not require a laboratory. But Lasarow added that effective UK-wide testing would rely on a number of different technologies \u2014 including so-called digital health passports \u2014 coming together."},

He has appealed the conviction.\u00a0 The Queen has today cancelled Weinstein\u2019s honorary CBE.\u00a0The decision was made at a meeting of the Honours Forfeiture Committee, which is independent from government. \u201cThe Queen has directed that the appointment of Harvey Weinstein to be an Honorary Commander of the Civil Division of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire, dated 29 January 2004, shall be cancelled and annulled,\u201d an official announcement said, according to Reuters. More than 100 women, including famous actresses, came forward to accuse Weinstein of sexual misconduct stretching back decades.\u00a0 The allegations against Weinstein, which he has denied, kicked off the #MeToo movement.\u00a0 At his trial earlier this year, prosecutors portrayed him as a serial predator who preyed upon women, manipulating them with promises of career advancement in Hollywood.\u00a0 \u201cThe young struggling dreamers were not even people to him. He could take what he wanted knowing there was very little anyone could do about it,\u201d Manhattan assistant district attorney Joan Illuzzi told the court. Weinstein said he was worried about the \u201cthousands of men who are losing due process\u201d during the #MeToo movement."}
