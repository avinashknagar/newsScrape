Both companies are trading\nin SEK on the Stockholm NASDAQ and Evolution Gaming is set to take NetEnt under\nits wing as it did eZugi Gaming. In one of the most competitive online industries in\nthe world, these two firms are currently in a head-to-head battle for market\nshare in the live dealer and virtual table gaming niche markets while NetEnt\nalso produces online video slots. Their games accept both cryptocurrency and fiat\ncurrency online betting and support multiple languages making them both global\nsensations in the online casino industry and fierce rivals.  However, that is all about to change in a deal said to\nbe worth \u20ac1.9 billion. Evolution Gaming is poised to buy all\nseries A and series B NetEnt shares on the  \nStockholm. The trade-off deal means NetEnt gets 0.1306 of every Evolution\nGaming share in exchange. The combination of the two firms will dominate the\niGaming industry as the two biggest names in the game will no longer be\ncompeting. It is a move that makes perfect sense because both companies are\nshowing success on the NASDAQ as we report below. Despite the competition, Evolution Gaming and NetEnt\nCasinos are still recording record revenues making them attractive investments.\nThey are the two largest live casino platform providers and are about to merge\nunder one company which will effectively blow the competition away. You find\nout  . Both firms lock horns in the live casino gaming\nenvironment and virtual table gaming arenas and their games are available at\nonline casinos around the globe.  Meanwhile, NetEnt also has another revenue stream coming\nfrom its vast collection of immensely popular online video slots. NetEnt\u2019s\nventure in the video slots industry was one of the firm\u2019s first endeavours into\nthe iGaming industry while Evolution is currently not in the business of slot\ndevelopment.  NetEnt is famous for its highly engaging progressive\njackpot slot games that can potentially pay out millions of Euros in prize\nmoney, while the firm also has over one hundred non-jackpot slots that come\nwith RTPs of up to ninety-nine per cent and high bet multipliers. The developer also releases at least two brand new\nslot games every month, keeping the firm\u2019s brand name fresh in the minds of its\nslot loving followers. It is fair to say business is booming for NetEnt in\nthe slot industry despite competing with over one hundred slot developers in\nthis sphere while the live casino industry only has around twenty plus\ncompetitors with Evolution Gaming being NetEnt\u2019s main competitor where both\nfirms are the leading platforms with Microgaming, Playtech, and Pragmatic Play\njust trailing. Over in the virtual table game genre of the iGaming\nindustry, Evolution Gaming is a new player in the market and has impressed with\nits fresh-looking VR style roulette, blackjack, and baccarat tables. While\nNetEnt designs virtual roulette, baccarat, and Texas Hold\u2019em Pro table games.  This is once again another incredibly competitive\narena in the iGaming industry, with around forty software developers competing\nfor market share. Right now, games from both firms can be found in all\nthe world\u2019s major iGaming countries such as the UK, Sweden, Germany, Canada,\nAustralia, New Zealand, and India. Impressively, Evolution Gaming is also penetrating the\nUS market, which is an extraordinary feat considering the multiple barriers to\nentry since the US government put in federal financial laws that restrict US\ncitizens from gambling online. However, state laws in place such as Delaware,\nNew Jersey, and Nevada open some doors for online casinos and Evolution Gaming\nis hot on the trail. These two firms are at the top of their game in every\nfield they compete in, and neither show any signs of slowing. This is reflected\nin their exciting SEK stock prices that continue to go from strength to\nstrength. Currently, the Evolution Gaming Group has over 181\nmillion shares floated and is listed under the \u2018Travel and Leisure\u2019 sector and\nhas 11,832 recorded trades while the trade volume is 833,522. Its impressive performance on the stock market over\nthe last 52 weeks has seen its stock rise from 185 to 701, and in 2020 each\nshare began at 269 and rose to 701. The iGaming brand\u2019s major push began in 2019 when in\nJanuary shares were valued at 109 and slowly steamed rolled up to 269 over the year.\nIt is 2020 that then saw the firm\u2019s share prices rise 160%. NetEnt has 206 million shares floated and is also\nlisted under the \u2018Travel and Leisure\u2019 sector. The number of trades on the\nNasdaq currently stands at 665 and the trade volume lists right now as 376,669. Its performance is equally as impressive as its live\ncasino platform rival, although shares are not as valuable. Its 52-week stats\nshow a rise from 15.3 to 90 and the same figures show for the firm\u2019s 1-year\ntotal. NetEnt\u2019s push in share price rises began way back in\n2013 after years of share price resistance between 10 and 12. From 2013 to\nmid-2016 shares steadily rose year on year to a high of 91 before dropping off\nto 15.3 by the end of 2019. 2020 is the return of NetEnt on the NASDAQ with a\nrise in the first 3 quarters to its current standing of 90. Currently, there are hundreds of competitors and new\nsoftware developers entering the market mainly under the wing of top iGaming\nsoftware firms such as Microgaming and Playtech.  For NetEnt\u2019s video slot market this is not ideal, but\nits brand is still revered amongst slot fans mainly because NetEnt has been\naround since the beginning of time. Whether Evolution Gaming\u2019s take over will\nrebrand NetEnt\u2019s slots or continue with the world-famous NetEnt brand name\nlabelling the video slot\u2019s division as \u2018Evolution Gaming NetEnt Slots\u2019 is not\npublic information at this time.  The virtual table gaming market is also seeing its\nfair share of new entrants and we are about to see existing brands and an\nincrease in new entrants in the live dealer sphere.  Whether the new competition affects iGaming companies\nfloated on stock markets remains to be seen.  However, with Evolution Gaming and NetEnt the two most\nused live dealer platforms in online casinos, it seems that this side of the\nbusiness is already locked up. Evolution Gaming also owns the eZugi live dealer\nplatform. With this in mind, it seems inevitable that the combination of both\nof these firms and their impressive NASDAQ performances makes Evolution Gaming\nshares an attractive investment. Adding to this, the iGaming industry is set for a huge\nrise in players and revenues. According to  ,\nin 2019 the industry was worth 58.9 billion and by 2023 it should rise to 92.9\nbillion. That is a formidable 57% rise which points to this market as the ideal\nsector for investment."},
